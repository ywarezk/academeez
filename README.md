## How Is Academeez Different?

We believe that learning to code should be **accessible, community-driven, and practical**. Unlike profit-focused platforms, Academeez is:

- **Open-source and MIT-licensed** â€” free for everyone, forever.  
- **Community-driven** â€” anyone can contribute lessons, exercises, and improvements.  
- **Focused on real-world coding** â€” lessons are built on modern tools, industry best practices, and collective community knowledge.  

By combining written lessons, videos, live coding, and hands-on repositories, Academeez ensures a complete learning experience that grows with you.
