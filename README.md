## What is academeez?

**academeez** is an **open-source, MIT-licensed** platform offering **community-driven coding lessons** for learners of all levels — from beginners taking their first steps in programming to experts looking to sharpen their skills.

Our mission is to make high-quality coding education accessible to everyone, and **academeez is completely free** to use. No registration is required to access the courses — simply dive in and start learning at your own pace.

**academeez** also features **online coding exercises powered by CodeSandbox**, enabling learners to practice coding directly in their browser without any setup. This ensures a seamless, hands-on learning experience where you can experiment, build, and refine your skills in real time.

Powered by contributions from a passionate community of developers, educators, and learners, academeez is your go-to resource for practical, interactive, and collaborative coding education.

## Why Do We Need Another Coding Courses Platform?

The primary goal of many online coding schools might seem like it’s to **educate programmers**, but in reality, their **main goal is to make money**. When profit comes first and education comes second, it often comes at a significant cost:

* Clickbait over quality: Many platforms focus on flashy marketing and exaggerated promises rather than providing meaningful, experience-driven content.
* Content disconnected from best practices: Lessons are often created without proper input from experienced developers or the larger programming community, leading to outdated or subpar educational material.
* Barrier to entry: If a platform requires you to register with your email or pay before even accessing lessons, it’s clear that their priority is collecting data or revenue, not advancing education.

Additionally, most content on these platforms is **locked behind paywalls**, which has far-reaching effects:

* It’s not properly indexed by search engines, making it harder to find useful content.
* It lacks **community input** and real-world feedback, which are essential for growth and improvement.

In contrast, the **open-source movement** has given us some of the most incredible tools and technologies we use today. So, why shouldn’t **coding education** follow the same principles — driven by **community, transparency, and collaboration**?

What we really need is a **Wikipedia-like platform** for coding education, where the best learning tools and resources are freely available and collaboratively created. Just like Wikipedia has become the go-to source for information, coding education should be a collective effort, where the community can create, review, and improve learning content for developers at every level.

Finally, if you ask experienced developers, you’ll find that at a certain level of expertise, they rarely rely on these platforms. Most online coding schools don’t cater to advanced learners, and the resources for experts are often lacking. While they might occasionally take courses to learn new technologies, there’s typically little value in the content when it comes to topics they’re already proficient in.

It’s time to shift from teaching code to make money to teaching code in the name of **improving coding education**.
