Lets give a simple use case of injection functions, and from that example try to understand a general best practice tip for using injection functions.

## DI

Usually we use the `DI` by injecting using the constructor.

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { Store } from '@ngrx/store';

@Component({...})
export class AppComponent {
	counter$ = this._store.select((state) => state.counter);
	
	constructor(private _store: Store) {}
}
``` 

In this example we inject the `Store` using the constructor, and then use the `Store` service to select data from the `State`.

## Problem

What if we want to read that `counter` in many components, what if we want to do some repeating manipulation on that data?  
Do we have to duplicate this logic along all the components?

Sure we can use [NGRX Selectors](https://ngrx.io/guide/store/selectors) and RXJS pipe to make a custom RXJS operator to extract that data, but we would still have to DI the `Store` service and call the `store.pipe`.  

In general with `NGRX` we have a lot of those initializers that subscribe to some section of the state.

## Injection Functions

When you have repeating initializations it's a good sign for using injection functions.  
Another way you can ask the `DI` to give you the `Store` service is by using the `inject` function:

```typescript
import { Component, inject } from '@angular/core';
import { Store } from '@ngrx/store';

@Component({...})
export class AppComponent {
	private _store: Store;
	counter$ = this._store.select((state) => state.counter);
	
	constructor() {
		this._store = inject(Store);
	}
}
```

In fact you can call the inject function from an [injection context](https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection-context) which includes those class props like `counter$`.  

With `injection function` the code above can turn to:

<div className="mt-5">
<Sandpack 
	customSetup={{ 
		dependencies: { 
			"@ngrx/store": "^16.3.0",
			"@angular/core": "^16.2.0",
			"@angular/platform-browser": "^16.2.0",
			"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic": "^16.2.0",
			"@angular/common": "^16.2.0",
			"@angular/compiler": "^16.2.0"
		}
	}}
	
	files={{
		"src/app/counter.selector.ts": {
			readOnly: true,	
			code: `import { inject } from '@angular/core';
import { Store } from '@ngrx/store';

export function useCounter() {
	return inject(Store).select((state) => state.counter);
}
			`
		},
		"src/app/app.module.ts": {
			hidden: true,
			readOnly: true,
			code: `import { BrowserModule } from "@angular/platform-browser";
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";

import { AppComponent } from "./app.component";
import { StoreModule } from "@ngrx/store";


@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule, StoreModule.forRoot({
		counter: () => 43
	}, {})],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}`
		},
		"src/app/app.component.ts": {
			readOnly: true,
			code: `import { Component, ChangeDetectionStrategy } from "@angular/core";
import { useCounter } from './counter.selector';


@Component({
	changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
	selector: "app-root",
	template: \`<h1>{{ counter$ | async }}</h1>\`
})
export class AppComponent {
	counter$ = useCounter();	
}`
		}
	}}
	
	template="angular" 
/>
</div>

The code is not only shorter, simpler, and cleaner, but also it makes your component easier to test, and easier to extend.  
You can use more logic to the `useCounter` if you need to manipulate the data in some way, and you can also use the same technique if for example you need initialization of server query for a component.

## Best Practice

So to summarize, if you have a repeating prop initializers in your class like: 
- server calls
- service usage
- grab of data from ngrx or elsewhere

instead of duplicating the logic you can use a reusable function that is using the `inject` function to inject the services.
