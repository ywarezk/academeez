[Angular](https://angular.io) is an open source framework, developed by Google, for creating web applications.

In this **FREE, OPEN SOURCE, FULL**, Angular course, you will learn the fundamentals of Angular for beginners, and more advanced angular topics for the more experienced developer.

## What we will learn

Angular is a full framework for web development, it contains many tools to accelerate and simplify your web development experience.  
Here's a sample of tools that angular provides that we will cover in this course:

- [Components](https://angular.io/guide/component-overview) - Components are the building blocks of Angular applications, they are the UI elements that make up your application.
- [Directives](https://angular.io/guide/built-in-directives) - Directives is a pretty cool unique feature of Angular, which allows you to add functionality to your HTML elements, HTML attributes and components.
- [Services](https://angular.io/guide/creating-injectable-service) - Services are the way you share data and functionality between components, we can place shared buisness logic in services.
