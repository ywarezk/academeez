To study api's it's best to code it yourself, so let's go over the proper way to create actions using NGRX.

## What are actions?

- Actions are sent to the store using `store.dispatch(someAction)`
- The store will send that actions to the reducers which often will result in a state change.

The meaning of an action is to say that something happened in the app, a lot of the times it's something that the user did like clicking a button or activating some sort of event.  
An action will often send additional data, for example if there is an action we want to send after a server response, we will often send the server response as the payload for the action.  
Action contains an identifier and optional payload data `{ type: string, additionalData?: ..., moreData?: ... }`.
