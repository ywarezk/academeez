In the following coding exercise we will do the following:

- Create a new Angular application
- Install `@ngrx/store`
- Install `@ngrx/store-devtools`
- Install Redux DevTools Chrome extension
- Populate the state with some data
- Inspect the state using Redux DevTools

We will cover here the starting point of combining Angular and NGRX, including some recommended tools and best practices you should use.

<Steps>

### Create a new Angular application

You can start a new Angular application using the Angular CLI.

```bash
npx @angular/cli@latest new ngrx-store-install --minimal --style css --routing false
```

This will create a new angular application, the `--minimal` flag will create a minimal application with minimum files (`--inline-template`, `--skip-tests`, `--inline-style`).  
We also choose to create the application with `css` style and without `routing`.

### Install @ngrx/store

Each of the `@ngrx/*` libraries has an `ng add` command that will install the library and add additional boilerplate code.

In your angular application run the following:

```bash
npx ng add @ngrx/store@latest --skip-confirmation
```

Running this command will npm install `@ngrx/store` and also add the following change to `src/app/app.module.ts`:

![app.module.ts changes](https://github.com/ywarezk/academeez/blob/main/content/en/course/angular/ngrx/installing-ngrx-store/ng-add-store-change.png?raw=true)

Notice that `NGRX` `StoreModule.forRoot({}, {})` is added to the `imports` array with empty objects, which mean we will have an empty state in `NGRX`.

### Install @ngrx/store-devtools

It's recommended that on `Angular+NGRX` applications, you will work with `@ngrx/store-devtools` which will allow you to inspect the state of your application.

```bash
npx ng add @ngrx/store-devtools@latest --skip-confirmation
```

</Steps>
