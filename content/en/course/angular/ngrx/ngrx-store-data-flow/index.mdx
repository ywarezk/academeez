Let's try to keep things simple and focus on the core of `@ngrx/store` and the basic data flow in an angular and `NGRX` application.  
We will target this lesson to understand 3 key elements from `@ngrx/store`:
- `Store`
- `Action`
- `Reducer`

With these elements and our angular components, there is a simple flow of data that is described in the following diagram:

This diagram does not represent the full diagram of `NGRX`, think of it as representing the engine of the car, to this diagram we will gradually add additional parts until we understand the entire car, but it's best to start with a simple version and build our way from there.

## Store

We will start by focusing on this part of the diagram:
