In this intermediate k8s course, we will learn how to manage your k8s cluster state using FluxCD.  
This means no more `kubectl apply ...` and no more `helm install ...` or any command that modified your cluster state.
Everything needs to be done via GitOps, using FluxCD, with files that are stored in a Git repository.  
We assume you have basic experience with k8s and that you have a cluster ready for this course and a `kubectl` command that communicates with that cluster. We recommend using a managed k8s cluster from a cloud provider.
