In the <Link className="duration-100 leading-normal transition ease-in hover:border-opacity-100 border-opacity-0 inline border-link border-b text-green" href="/en/course/react/component">previous lesson</Link> we learned that React is a library that helps us create a UI component.
We also learned that to create a component in React, we need to create a function that returns how that component looks like.
React components are reusable ui, which can be placed on desired places in the screen (can also be placed multiple times in different places).
When you create a component, you can place it in the screen by using its function name as a tag inside another React component.

Let's give a simple example, in the following example we have two components that are located in two different files:
- `App.js` - This is the component that represents the entire screen.
- `Login.js` - This is a component that represents the login form (same one we created in the previous lesson).

<div className="mt-5">
<Sandpack 
	
	files={{
		"App.js": {
			readOnly: true,
			code: `
import Login from "./Login"

export default function App() {
  return (
		<div>
			<header>
				<h1>This is the header of the screen</h1>				
			</header>
			<Login />
			<footer>
				<h5>This is the footer</h5>
			</footer>
		</div>
  )
}`
		},
		"Login.js": {
			readOnly: true,
			code: `export default function Login() {
	return (
		<form>
			<div>
				<label>Username</label>
				<input type="text" />
			</div>
			<div>
				<label>Password</label>
				<input type="password" />
			</div>
			<div>
				<button type="submit">Login</button>
			</div>
		</form>
	)
}
`
		}
	}}
	template="react" 
/>
</div>

Few things to note in the following example:

### Component tree

React application is made from a tree of components, usually the root of the component represents the entire application, or the root represents the current screen from the web application that we are visiting. This means that a screen like this:

![React component tree](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ywarezk/academeez/main/content/en/course/react/component-tag/tree.png)

We can create this screen with the following components:
