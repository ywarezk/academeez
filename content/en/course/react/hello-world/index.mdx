In this lesson we will create a simple component that displays an hello world message.
At the end of this article you will have a short student exercise to practice what you learned, and you will write your first React component.  
To complete the exercise you can write the code here in the site and see the results.

We are going to create a simple hello world website using React, and by doing that get to know a few basics about React.

## Component is a function

Creating a component in React is simply creating a function that returns your ui.

```javascript
function HelloWorld() {
	return <h1>Hello World</h1>;
}
```
