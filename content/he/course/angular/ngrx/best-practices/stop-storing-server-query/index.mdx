Let's examine this simple scenario:

-   Angular application
-   with service that fetch a list of github repositories
-   Display the list of repositories in `AppComponent`

<div className="mt-5">
<Sandpack 
	customSetup={{ 
		dependencies: { 			
			"@angular/core": "^17.0.0",
			"@angular/platform-browser": "^17.0.0",
			"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic": "^17.0.0",
			"@angular/common": "^17.0.0",
			"@angular/compiler": "^17.0.0"
		}
	}}
	
	files={{
		"src/app/app.module.ts": {
			hidden: true,
			readOnly: true,
			code: `import { BrowserModule } from "@angular/platform-browser";
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";

import { AppComponent } from "./app.component";
import { HttpClientModule } from "@angular/common/http";

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule, HttpClientModule],
  providers: \[],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}`		},
		"src/app/github.service.ts": {
			readOnly: true,
			code:`import { HttpClient } from "@angular/common/http";
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";

@Injectable({
  providedIn: "root",
})
export class GithubService {
  constructor(private \_http: HttpClient) {}

  getRepos() {
    return this.\_http.get("https://api.github.com/users/colt/repos");
  }
}`		},
		"src/app/app.component.ts": {
			readOnly: true,
			code:`import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { GithubService } from "./github.service";

@Component({
  selector: "app-root",
  template: \`
    <h1>Repo list</h1>
    <ul>
      \<li \*ngFor="let repo of repos$ | async">
        {{ repo.name }}
      </li>
    </ul>
  \`,
})
export class AppComponent {
  repos$ = this.\_github.getRepos();
  constructor(private \_github: GithubService) {}
}
\`
		}
	}}
	
	template="angular" 
/>

</div>

Everything is working great, but then you have to use the same list of repositories in another component. You could just call the service again, but that would be a waste of resources. So you decide to store the list of repositories in NGRX store.\
There are few ways that can be achieved (which are all wrong):

-   Dispatch proper actions in components (worst of the wrong solutions)
-   Use `@ngrx/effects` and make each component dispatch an intent to read that data (a bit better)
-   Use `@ngrx/data` which will save you a lot of boilerplate code, but still requires you to configure it properly (best of the wrong solutions).

## The problem with storing server query in NGRX

If you are using NGRX to store server query, there is a lot of complexity you will have to face. This complexity today has led me to the believe that there is application state, and query cache, and those things should be seperated.\
Using NGRX to store server query has lots of boiler plate code, and it is not easy to get it right.\
Let's see what are the problems with storing server query in NGRX.

### @ngrx/effects

If you are using `@ngrx/effects` to store server query, here is all the things you will have to do:

-   create reducer - you can use `@ngrx/entity` to help you with that (will help you also with selectors)
-   create action to set the list of repositories
-   create effect for acting on components intent to read the data

All the things above will consist of ton of boiler plate code, not to mention that we are not dealing properly with stale data (will be discussed later).

### @ngrx/data

The goal of `@ngrx/data` is to reduce the boilerplate code, and it works nice if your backend api is exactly like the conventions they expect (which 99% is not the case). And then you will have to face configuring `@ngrx/data` which is not such a simple case and bad documentation makes it even harder to understand how to configure.\
Morover, look at this diagram which is posted in `@ngrx/data`:

![@ngrx/data flow](https://ngrx.io/generated/images/guide/data/action-flow.png)

server query cache needs to be simple, most of the developers that are using `@ngrx/data` I'm not convincede that they fully understand what actually happens, which makes it even harder to understand and debug once there are issues.
