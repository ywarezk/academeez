`NGRX` is a **STATE** management library, in this lesson we will learn the basic rules about the state that is managed by `NGRX`.

## About NGRX State

The state in an `Object` that `NGRX` holds.\
Components can choose to subscribe to state change, and get notified when the state is changing, they will then render the UI with the new data.\
Components can also tell `NGRX` to replace the state with a new state, so a state can always be replaced with a new state.\
We can look at the state as the data snapshot at a certain time point, and NGRX holds the current present state.

## Counter app example

Let's examine the state in this simple counter app:

![counter app](https://github.com/ywarezk/academeez/blob/main/content/en/course/angular/ngrx/state/state.gif?raw=true)

The app will increase the counter every button click.\
The counter value is taken from `NGRX`.\
Using [Redux Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd) we can examine the state the `NGRX` holding at the right side of the screen.\
From that simple state we can understand a few facts about the state that is managed by `NGRX`, which is rules that are also derived from the base of `Redux` which `NGRX` is an implementation of.

## State has an initial value

Notice that the state is a simple object that looks like so:

```json
{
  "counter": 0
}
```

That object starts with an initial value of 0.\
`NGRX` state has an initial value that we will have to supply when we configure `NGRX` (Same with `Redux` we have to supply the initial value of the state)

## State is an Object

Our state is a simple `Javascript` `Object`

## Recommendation: State should be serializable

## State is immutable
