# Lesson Plan

<div className="mt-7">
In the **Quick React Introduction** chapter, we will develop a simple web site using [React](https://react.dev).  
We will learn how to use **React** to draw our website screen, and learn a quick introduction to how you develop using **React**.  
The idea is to give you a taste of **React** develelopment so you can understand what this course is about, and have a general idea if it's something you are intrested in learning.
