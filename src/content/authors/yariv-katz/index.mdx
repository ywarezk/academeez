Been writing web applications since the late 90's, and still love it. I'm a full stack developer, and I'm passionate about web technologies. I'm the founder of [Academeez](https://www.academeez.com), an open source learning platform for coders, and the founder of [Nerdeez](https://www.nerdeez.com/) my web consulting company.  
During my career I've been CTO of several startups, and I've been a consultant for many companies.  
Did my computer science degree in the Technion, and I'm a proud father of 2 dogs :).  

Today I give lectures on web technologies, and I'm a mentor for many developers, and consultant architecture for a few startup companies.
