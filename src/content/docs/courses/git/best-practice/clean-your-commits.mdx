When you look at your version control history, you want to see a clean and readable history. 
Think of your version control, in this lesson we will demonstrate with [git](https://git-scm.com/), as telling a story, the story of evolution of your software.
The story has chapters which are the pr's, and the commits are the paragraphs of the chapters.
Reading the version control history should be like reading a book, you should be able to understand the evolution of the software by reading the commit messages.

## Developers common mistakes with commits

There are repeating mistakes that developers do when they commit their changes.
In this lesson we will focus on a common mistake that developers are sharing a really messy commit history.
Before submitting your work for PR you should clean your commits.
common `git` commands that will help you do that which we will practice in this lesson are:
- `git commit --amend`
- `git rebase -i`
- `git reset`
- `git stash`

We will take those commands and different use cases and learn how to use them to clean your commits.

## We start by planning our work

Before we jump in to write code, we should plan our work.
The process of planning your work is different from one developer to another, or between organizations.
Some create [PRD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_requirements_document), some [Design Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_review), some create [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments), and some just do the planning in their head.
We will not focus on the planning phase, but rather the result of that phase.
The result is a general plan of what you are going to do, and a general workflow of writing code to solve the problem.
In general what we are doing is taking a problem, breaking it down to smaller problems, breaking the smaller problems to even smaller ones, and recursively do the same process until the problems are small enough for us to write code and solve them.
Those problems that we solve we code them in logical groups and when finishing with a logical group of changes we can create a commit.
This means that the commit should be derived from your plan.
Not to say that plans don't change during development, so it's not going to be identical, but you should see a commit history that resembles and slowly build up to solve the problem according to the plan.

## Our simple plan

Let's create a plan for a simple task assigned to us.
We are told to create a header for a website.
The header contains a logo, navigation, and a search bar.
Seems like a simple task, but we will break it down to smaller problems:
1. create the logo
2. create the search bar
3. create the navigation

We will open a new branch for the task, and since our commits should reflect the plan, we imagine that our commit diagram will look like this:

![commit diagram](https://github.com/ywarezk/academeez/blob/main/content/en/course/git/best-practices/clean-your-commits/plan-commits.png?raw=true)

In the diagram we see that we open a branch called `feat/header` and we have 3 commits, each commit solves a problem from our plan, so the first commit in the branch will have the message:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: created the header logo"
```

The second commit in the branch will have the message:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: created the header search bar"
```

And the third commit in the branch will have the message:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: created the header navigation"
```

## What happened to our plan in reality

Mike Tyson once said: 
> **"Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face."**

And this is an example of what happened to our plan.

![git bad example](https://github.com/ywarezk/academeez/blob/main/content/en/course/git/best-practices/clean-your-commits/git-bad-example3.gif?raw=true)

So in reality our plan turned out like so:
1. create the logo
2. Create the search bar
3. Fix the logo css
4. create the navigation
5. Fix search bar bug
6. Fix navigation lint bug

The problem is that we looked at our progress as linear progress and not as logical groups of changes.
If we look at the commits differently we might unite together the commit with the creating logo and css fix of the logo, and do a similar thing and group the search bar commits and the navigation commits.
We often created commits then we get distracted so we create a **WIP** (work in progress), we switch branches to solve a bug in the main branch, we get remarks about css, and other distractions.
Often it will cause our git history to be a mess.
We need to think before automatically commiting all changes, think about our plan, think about the logical group of progress in our plan,
and not necessarily see the commits as a linear progress history.
Let's examine different tools git provides us to clean our commits.
Tools that we have to learn in order to control how our git history looks like, and make it as clean and understandable as possible.
But first let's answer **Why???** why should I bother cleaning my commits?

## Why bother

Why is it that important the my git history is clean?

- **Readability**: You should be able to understand the evolution of the software by reading the commit messages.
- **Debugging**: If you have a bug in your code, you should be able to find the commit which introduced the bug.
- **Reverting**: If you need to revert a change, you should be able to find the commit which introduced the change.
- **Code review**: If you are doing code review, you should be able to understand the changes by reading the commit messages.

Let's go over different tools, and use cases that git provides us to clean our commits.

## `git commit --amend`

The `git commit --amend` command is used to add changes to the last commit.
You can use it when working on your branch and before sharing your changes with others.
You should not do it to shared branches, like `main` or `develop`, it will require a force push and it will mess up the history of other developers.
But when working on your branch, you can use it to change the last commit, and you can feel free to force push on your branch when you know it's not shared.

Let's see an example, let's say you are working on the `feat/header` branch and you created a commit with the message `feat: created the header logo`,
After you created the commit the project manager sees your work and tell you to do some css changes.
Instead of creating a new commit, since it's still the same logical group of changes, you can do the css changes and then do:

```bash
git add -A
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

This will add the css changes to the last commit, so now you only have one commit of creating the logo.
You can also change the commit message by dropping the `--no-edit` flag.

## `git reset`

`git reset` is a powerful command that can be used to undo changes.
If used without the `--hard` flag it will keep the changes in the working directory, and will just remove commits, allowing you to restructure the commits.
Let's see an example, let's say you are working on the `feat/header` branch and you created a commit with the message `feat: created the header logo and the search bar`,
You look at the amount of changes and you notice that your commit includes a lot of changes (it's a common mistake to create single all encapsulating commits), and you want to split it to two commits.
One commit for the changes that are related to the logo, and one commit for the changes that are related to the search bar.

You can do:

```bash
git reset HEAD~1
```

This will remove the last commit, but the changes will still be in the working directory.
Now you can add the changes related to the logo and create a commit, and then add the changes related to the search bar and create a commit.
It's easy to use it to restructure your commits, but in the case where you want to change a commit that is located 20 places back in the history, it's a bit harder to use.
In that case you can use the `git rebase -i` command.

## `git rebase -i`

`git rebase -i` is a powerful command that allows you to change the history of your commits.
In my opinion it's the most important command to arrange a clean git history, which describes accurately the evolution of the software.
The command allows you to squash commits, edit commits, reorder commits, and more.
Let's examine two cases where we use the `git rebase -i` command for editing commits, and squashing commits.

### Editing commits

Let's say you are working on the `feat/header` branch and you created a commit with the message `feat: created the header logo`,
After that you created 10 different commits, and then the project manager tells you that there are some css changes that need to be done to the logo.
We can create those changes but maybe it's best to add them to the commit that created the logo.
Say we create the css changes, before we stage them we can do:

```bash
git stash
```

To hold the changes in memory.
Then we can do:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~11
```

find the commit we want to change and changing the word `pick` to `edit`, this will place us in the commit we want to change.
We can then pop our changes with the command

```bash
git stash pop
```

we can stage the changes and ammend the commit with the command

```bash
git add -A
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

We changed the commit without creating a new commit, and we can continue the rebase with the command

```bash
git rebase --continue
```

When editing commits we will often combine the `git rebase -i` command and also use `git stash` or `git commit --amend` or `git reset` to further make changes
when we are in the commit we want to edit.

### Squashing commits

Let's say you are working on the `feat/header` branch and you created 5 different commits that are related to the search bar.
For cleaner history you want to merge them together, one option is to use `git reset` if they are the last commits, but if they are not the last commits you can use the `git rebase -i` command.
change the word `pick` to `squash` for all the commits you want to squash, and then save and close the editor.

## Summary

The main point of this lesson is not for you to remember all those commands,
The point is that you should remember to keep your git history clean, and readable.
You can squash, edit, change commits, you can add changes to previous commits, and you can make the history clean before sharing with your team.
You will reap the benefits of a clean history when you need to debug, revert, or understand the evolution of the software.
Once you understand the philosophy of keeping a clean history, you will naturally use the tools that git provides you to keep it clean, and when you practice it you will
become better at it and controler all those commands we learned in this lesson
