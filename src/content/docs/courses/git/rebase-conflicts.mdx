I see many developers struggle with using `git rebase` and I think the main reason of the struggle is 
caused by the conflicts that arise when rebasing.
So right from the start let's clarify something:
**Does `git rebase` has more conflicts than `merge`?**: The answer is if you **know what you are doing** than usually no - the number of conflicts will be the same.
The **know what you are doing** is often the problem.
If you are working in a branch and your commits are **messy** (We will explain what messy means) then you will have ton of conflicts when working with rebase.
In this article we will try and understand how `git rebase` works, and why we have so many conflicts when rebasing.

## Rebase and Merge

Let's start by understanding what `git rebase` and `git merge` are doing.

Our starting point is that we started from a branch called `main`.
We wanted to work on a new feature, so we created a new branch called `feature`.
We created a few commits on the `feature` branch and while we were working on the branch, the `main` branch was updated with new commits.

![feature main commits](https://github.com/ywarezk/academeez/blob/main/content/en/course/angular/ngrx/ngrx-store-data-flow/store-state-angular.png?raw=true)

We want to get the new commits from `main` into our `feature/something` branch.
Usually developers will do something like this:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

this is assuming that they are now on the `feature/something` branch.
We will discuss what this command does in a moment.
But let's assume something else, let's assume our local repository `main` branch is up to date with the remote `main` branch.
Now to get the new commits from `main` into our `feature/something` branch we can do one of two things:

1. We can use `git merge` to merge the `main` branch into our `feature/something` branch.

```bash
git merge main
```

This assumes we are on the `feature/something` branch.

2. We can use `git rebase` to rebase our `feature/something` branch on top of the `main` branch.

```bash
git rebase main
```

Let's try and understand what each of these commands does.
