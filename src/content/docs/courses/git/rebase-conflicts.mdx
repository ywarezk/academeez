I see many developers struggle with using `git rebase` and I think the main reason of the struggle is 
caused by the conflicts that arise when rebasing.
So right from the start let's clarify something:
**Does `git rebase` has more conflicts than `merge`?**: The answer is neither yes or no - annoying I know, we love to hear a black and white answer, but the truth often lies in the gray area, 
and it oftens depends on the developer plan and experience.

Let's start by understanding why the usually when we start using `git rebase` we stumble on many conflicts.


## Rebase and Merge

Our starting point is that we started from a branch called `main`.
We wanted to work on a new feature, so we created a new branch called `feature/`.
