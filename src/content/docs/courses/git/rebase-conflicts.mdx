I see many developers struggle with using `git rebase` and I think the main reason of the struggle is 
caused by the conflicts that arise when rebasing.
So right from the start let's clarify something:
**Does `git rebase` has more conflicts than `merge`?**: The answer is if you **know what you are doing** than usually no - the number of conflicts will be the same.
The **know what you are doing** is often the problem.
If you are working in a branch and your commits are **messy** (We will explain what messy means) then you will have ton of conflicts when working with rebase.
In this article we will try and understand how `git rebase` works, and why we have so many conflicts when rebasing.

## Rebase and Merge

Let's start by understanding what `git rebase` and `git merge` are doing.

Our starting point is that we started from a branch called `main`.
We wanted to work on a new feature, so we created a new branch called `feature`.
We created a few commits on the `feature` branch and while we were working on the branch, the `main` branch was updated with new commits.

we are on the `feaure` branch and we want to get the new commits from `main` into our `feature` branch we can do one of two things:

1. We can use `git merge` to merge the `main` branch into our `feature` branch.

```bash
git merge main
```

This assumes we are on the `feature` branch.

2. We can use `git rebase` to rebase our `feature` branch on top of the `main` branch.

```bash
git rebase main
```

Let's try and understand what each of these commands does.

### Git Merge

When we run `git merge main` we are telling git to merge the `main` branch into our current branch.
Git will create a new commit that combines the changes from both branches.
This new commit will have two parents: the last commit on the `main` branch and the last commit on the `feature` branch.

![merge main](https://github.com/ywarezk/academeez/blob/main/src/content/docs/courses/git/rebase-conflicts/merge-main.png?raw=true)

Notice that a new commit was added on the `feature` branch.

### Git Rebase

When we run `git rebase main` we are telling git to take all the commits from the `feature` branch and replay them on top of the `main` branch.
Git will take each commit from the `feature` branch and apply it on top of the `main` branch.
This means that the commits from the `feature` branch will be added to the `main` branch one by one.
