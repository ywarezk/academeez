I see many developers struggle with using `git rebase` and I think the main reason of the struggle is 
caused by the conflicts that arise when rebasing.
So right from the start let's clarify something:
**Does `git rebase` has more conflicts than `merge`?**: The answer is if you **know what you are doing** than usually no - the number of conflicts will be the same.
The **know what you are doing** is often the problem.
If you are working in a branch and your commits are **messy** (We will explain what messy means) then you will have ton of conflicts when working with rebase.
In this article we will try and understand how `git rebase` works, and why we have so many conflicts when rebasing.

## Rebase and Merge

Let's start by understanding what `git rebase` and `git merge` are doing.

Our starting point is that we started from a branch called `main`.
We wanted to work on a new feature, so we created a new branch called `feature`.
We created a few commits on the `feature` branch and while we were working on the branch, the `main` branch was updated with new commits.

![feature main commits](https://github.com/ywarezk/academeez/blob/main/src/content/docs/courses/git/rebase-conflicts/feature-main1.png?raw=true)

we are on the `feaure` branch and we want to get the new commits from `main` into our `feature` branch we can do one of two things:

1. We can use `git merge` to merge the `main` branch into our `feature` branch.

```bash
git merge main
```

This assumes we are on the `feature` branch.

2. We can use `git rebase` to rebase our `feature` branch on top of the `main` branch.

```bash
git rebase main
```

Let's try and understand what each of these commands does.

### Git Merge

When we run `git merge main` we are **telling** git to merge the `main` branch into our current branch.
Git will create a new commit that combines the changes from both branches.
This new commit will have two parents: the last commit on the `main` branch and the last commit on the `feature` branch.

![merge main](https://github.com/ywarezk/academeez/blob/main/src/content/docs/courses/git/rebase-conflicts/merge-main.png?raw=true)

Notice that a new commit was added on the `feature` branch.

### Conflicts with Merge

Let's examine the image above and imagine that on the `feature` branch in commit `1` we installed some package using `npm install <some-package1>`.
Then in the same branch in commit `3` we installed another package using `npm install <some-package2>`.
So in commit `1` and commit `3` we have changes in the `package.json` file.

Now let's imagine in the `main` branch in commit `C` another developer installed a package using `npm install <some-package3>`.
So in commit `C` we also have changes in the `package.json` file.
Now when we try to merge the `main` branch into our `feature` branch, there is a good chance that we will have a conflict in the `package.json` file.

Let's define 2 concepts that relate to conflicts and their value when doing a merge:
- `ours` - the changes that we made in our branch (the `feature` branch).
- `theirs` - the changes that were made in the other branch (the `main` branch).

In the following conflict we will have a conflict on the `package.json` file, where `ours` is the aggregated change in `package.json` from commit `1` and commit `3` and `theirs` is the change in `package.json` from commit `C`.

So we will have one conflict to solve on the `package.json` file.

### Git Rebase

When we run `git rebase main` we are telling git to take all the commits from the `feature` branch and replay them on top of the `main` branch.
Git will take each commit from the `feature` branch and apply it on top of the `main` branch.
This means that the commits from the `feature` branch will be added to the `main` branch one by one.

![rebase main](https://github.com/ywarezk/academeez/blob/main/src/content/docs/courses/git/rebase-conflicts/rebase-anim4.gif?raw=true)

### Conflicts with Rebase

Same conflict scenario as before. we installed some package using `npm install <some-package1>` in commit `1` and in commit `3` we installed another package using `npm install <some-package2>`.
In the `main` branch in commit `C` another developer installed a package using `npm install <some-package3>`.

Let's define 2 concepts that relate to conflicts and their value when doing a rebase - Notice that the `ours` and `theirs` are different than the merge:
- `ours` - represet the branch that we rebase on top of (the `main` branch).
- `theirs` - represent the commit that we are trying to rebase (the `feature` branch).

Now here is the catch:
When we rebase we might have conflicts on every commit that we are trying to rebase.
So in our case we will have a conflict on commit `1` that introduced a change in `package.json` that we will have to solve before the rebase can continue.
Then we will have to solve another conflict on `package.json` in commit `3`.

This means that in our Rebase example we had to solve 2 conflicts on the `package.json` file, while in the Merge example we only had to solve one conflict on the `package.json` file.

Is seems from this example that `git rebase` has more conflicts than `git merge`.
OR IS IT?

### git rebase interactive mode

Rebase interactive mode gives you a chance to edit the commits that you are rebasing. You can change the commit message, squash commits, drop commits, reorder commits, and more.
There are times when we code something commit and then after few commits in the future we realize that a commit we made had issues and needs a bit of change.
We can fix the issue and create a new commit but that's not always the best solution.

Let's try to explain the problem with an example.
Let's say you have a task where you need to install a package that will help you with **PDF** files, and using that package you will have
to read the pdf, and search for a specific string.
You find a popular package `pdf-reader` and you install it.
You create your first commit `chore: install pdf-reader` and you start working on the task.
You implement reading the pdf and create another commit `feat: read pdf`.
You find out that the package you chose cannot be used for searching for a string in the pdf.
You decide to go with a different package `pdf-lib` that can do the job.
you create a new commit `chore: install pdf-lib` and you start working on the task again.
You implement reading the pdf and create a commit and also searching for a string in the pdf and create another commit.
Then you realize that the package you chose are not maintained and has a lot of issues.
The you decide to go with a 3rd package `awesome-pdf` which you manage to create all the features you need.
So a commit history in your branch might look like this:

![rebase interactive1](https://github.com/ywarezk/academeez/blob/main/src/content/docs/courses/git/rebase-conflicts/rebase-interactive1.png?raw=true)

That trial and error is not necessarily something you want to keep in your commit history, and at times can be sufficent just placing a trial you did in a commit body instead of creating a full commit.
For example that same commit history can be arranged differently using git rebase interactive mode:

![rebase interactive2](https://github.com/ywarezk/academeez/blob/main/src/content/docs/courses/git/rebase-conflicts/rebase-interactive2.png?raw=true)

I would argue that the second commit history is much cleaner and easier to understand.
And what about conflicts?

If we take the previous example that we had a conflict on the `package.json`, in the example where we don't arrange and squash our commits properly
we might have conflicts like the number of commits that changed the `package.json` file.
Which means in this example we will have 3 conflicts, on the other hand after arranging and squashing our commits we will have only one conflict on the `package.json` file because only one commit is changing that file.

And to give a few examples how to arrange and maintain a clean commit history, we highly recommend
to read a tutorial we wrote on the topic: [Clean your commits](https://www.academeez.com/courses/git/best-practice/clean-your-commits)
