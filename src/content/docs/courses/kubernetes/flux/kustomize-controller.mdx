The `kustomize-controller` is looking at a `Kustomization` custom resource in the cluster (One entry point `Kustomization` was created on `flux bootstrap`).
`Kustomization` custom resource will contain a `sourceRef` and a `path` to a folder.
That folder can contain a `kustomization.yaml` file, which will contain a list of resources, and the `kustomize-controller` will strive to get the cluster state according to those resources.
If the `kustomization.yaml` file is not present, then the `kustomize-controller` will generate a `kustomization.yaml` file based on the resources in the folder.

## kustomize, kustomize-controller, kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1 - Kustomization, kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1 - Kustomization

This is where things get a bit confusing. There are two different `Kustomization` resources, one from the `kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1` API group, which is client only and not created in the cluster, and one from the `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1` API group which is a custom resource added to our cluster.
In addition there is the `kustomize` tool, and the `kustomize-controller` which is part of the `flux` project.
We need to understand each of these components and how they relate to each other.

## kustomize

`kustomize` kind of remind me of a very simplified version of `helm`. You feed kustomize with a `Kustomization` resource that looks like so:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
- flux-system
- namespace.yaml
```

Here's an example of a `Kustomization` resource, `kustomize` based on this file will create the group of resources which we can feed `kubectl` and those resources will be created. 
It's important to note that this `Kustomization` resource is not a custom resource in the cluster, it's just a file that `kustomize` will use to generate resources.

`kustomize` can be externally installed but it's also now baked as part of `kubectl`.

```bash
kubectl kustomize <kustomization_directory>
```

Will show you the resources that will be created.

```bash
kubectl apply -k <kustomization_directory>
```

Will create the resources.
This is not a `kustomize` lesson and there are plenty good lessons about this tool, and I'm assuming you have a bit of experience with it.
We will however do a recap of the important features of this tool which we are going to utilize.

## Install kustomize

Although `kustomize` is now baked into `kubectl`, you can still install it separately.
The easiest way is using `homebrew`:

```bash
brew install kustomize
```

After installation you will have the `kustomize` command available. This command will not effect your cluster, and personally I love to use it as a tool to understand what is created, and patched.

## kustomization.yaml

There is a special meaning for files named `kustomization.yaml` in a directory. Kustomize is given a directory, and it will look for a file named `kustomization.yaml` in that directory. If that file does not exist then kustomize will fail to generate the resources.

## kustomize create

kustomize can help you create a `kustomization.yaml` file based on the resources in a directory.

```bash
cd clusters/staging && kustomize create --autodetect --recursive
```

You can cd into a directory containing `yaml` resources, and you can run `kustomize create --autodetect --recursive` and it will generate a `kustomization.yaml` file based on the resources in that directory. 
This is a very useful feature, and it's the feature that the `kustomize-controller` will use if the `kustomization.yaml` file is not present.

## kustomize build

I use this command often, it's a way to see the resources that will be created by `kustomize-controller`.
The command will not actually create the resources, it will just show you the resources that will be created.

```bash
kustomize build <kustomization_directory>
```

## patch

It's important to go over this feature in the `Kustomization` resource since we will use it often, especially when we have similar configurations between clusters.  
For example we might have a base infastructure configuration between the clusters, but there are some minor configuration changes in that base infastructure between the clusters, often
kustomization patches will allow us that distinction.

There are 2 types of patches, `patchesStrategicMerge` and `patchesJson6902`.

### patchesStrategicMerge

This is a list of file paths, and kustomize will merge these files with the resources in the `kustomization.yaml` file.

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
- flux-system
- namespace.yaml
patches:
- patch.yaml
```
In this example we will use the `patch.yaml` to add annotation to the `source-controller` `ServiceAccount`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
	name: source-controller
	namespace: flux-system
	annotations:
		iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account: source-controller@prj-academeez.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

This is the content of the file `patch.yaml`, and it will add the annotation to the `source-controller` `ServiceAccount`. 
It will look for the `ServiceAccount` with the name `source-controller` in the `flux-system` namespace and it will add the annotation.

### patchesJson6902

In this merge type, we can use a `json` patch to merge with the resources in the `kustomization.yaml` file.
This can be used for a more surgical approach to patching a field or multiple fields instead of merging bulk of data.

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
- flux-system
- namespace.yaml
patches:
- target:
	kind: ServiceAccount
	name: source-controller
	namespace: flux-system
	version: v1
	path: patch.yaml
```

and in the `patch.yaml` file we can have the following content:

```yaml
- op: add
  path: /metadata/annotations/iam.gke.io~1gcp-service-account
  value: "source-controller@prj-academeez.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
```

We will use this patch technique when we talk about workload identity and accessing out private helm repository.
		
## overlays

Another feature we will use often is the `overlays` feature. This is a way to have a base configuration and then have different configurations for different clusters.
Let's examine the following simple example. In the root directory create a folder called `apps`, this folder will contain our clusters app configurations.
Later in the course we will have a slight difference between the `staging` and `production` apps, they will be installed by our private helm which we will configure in future lesson, and we will distinguish between chart versions with canary that will be loaded to `staging` cluster and the stable version that will be loaded to `production` cluster.

In the `apps` directory create a `base` directory, which will contain app configurations that are common to all clusters.
Let's create the file `release.yaml` in the `apps/base` directory with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta2
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: hello
  namespace: www
spec:
  interval: 10m
  timeout: 5m
  chart:
    spec:
      chart: hello
      repository: https://charts.example.com      
      # version: "..." modify this per cluster
      sourceRef:
        kind: HelmRepository
        name: hello  
```

Notice that we omitted the `version` field, we will use the `overlays` feature to add this field per cluster, loading `canary` versions to the staging cluster.
In the `apps/base` create also a `kustomization.yaml` file with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - release.yaml
```

For now this `kustomization.yaml` file only package all the resources in the directory, but we will use it later to add common labels, namespace and other configurations that relates to all the resources in this directory.

In the `apps` directory create a `staging` directory, which will contain app configurations that are specific to the `staging` cluster. 
In the `apps/staging` directory create a `kustomization.yaml` file with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - ../base
patches:
  - path: release.yaml
    target:
      kind: HelmRelease
```

We added a `patches` field that targets the `HelmRelease` kind, and we will use this field to add the `version` field to the `HelmRelease` resource.

Create the file `release.yaml` in the `apps/staging` directory with the following content:

```yaml
- op: add
  path: /spec/chart/spec/version
  value: ">=1.0.0-canary"
```

We will create the same files in the `apps/staging` also in the `apps/production` directory, but the `version` field will be different.
Modify the file `apps/production/release.yaml` to have the following content:

```yaml
- op: add
  path: /spec/chart/spec/version
  value: ">=1.0.0"
```

We can test our overlays by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl kustomize apps/staging
kubectl kustomize apps/production
```

You should see how the configurations for the 2 clusters are identical except for the `version` field. Overlays usually combines with `patches` to create similar clusters with slight differences.

This is the recap we need about the `kustomize` tool, Now let's move to the `kustomize-controller` and the `Kustomization` custom resource.

## kustomize-controller

The `kustomize-controller` is a [kubernetes operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) which is using a `Kustomization` custom resource that points a path in a source (usually a git repository).
Based on `kustomization.yaml` in the path (or if not present it is generated) resources are created in the cluster, and the state of our cluster is maintained.

## Kustomization custom resource

After installing flux we now have 2 `Kustomization` resources, one from the `kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1` API group, and one from the `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1` API group.
It was confusing for me at first, and it's important to understand the difference between the two, and look at the `apiVersion` field to distinguish.
Remember that flux resources have `<controller>.toolkit.fluxcd.io` in the `apiVersion`.
Here's an example of a flux `Kustomization` resource and we will go over the important fields:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: apps
  namespace: www
spec:
  interval: 10m0s
  path: ./clusters/staging
  prune: true
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: flux-system
    namespace: flux-system
```

Let's go over the important fields:

- **metadata.namespace** - The `Kustomization` resource doesn't have to be in the `flux-system` namespace, Although I usually put it there.
- **spec.interval** - The interval in which the `kustomize-controller` will examine the resource, check the cluster, and correct any drifting to match the cluster state to the resources in the `kustomization.yaml` file.
- **spec.path** - The path to the folder in the source (git repository in this case) that contains the `kustomization.yaml` file (if no `kustomization.yaml` it will be generated - more on that later).
- **spec.prune** - If set to `true` removed resources will be garbage collected, I turn this on must of the times.
- **spec.sourceRef** - The `sourceRef` field is a reference to a `source-controller` custom resource, in this course we will use `GitRepository` custom resource - this points to where the `path` directory is located, and where our yaml files to apply reside.

## kustomize-controller entry point

When we ran `flux bootstrap` a flux `Kustomization` resource was created in the `flux-system` namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: flux-system
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 10m0s
  path: ./clusters/staging
  prune: true
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: flux-system

```

This is our entry point for the `kustomize-controller` and the path is set to `./clusters/staging` according to the `--path` flag in the `flux bootstrap` command.

## kustomization.yaml generation

Notice that the path `./clusters/staging` does not contain a `kustomization.yaml` yet the `kustomize-controller` did not complain.
If the `Kustomization` resource is pointing to a path that does not contain a `kustomization.yaml` file, then the `kustomize-controller` will generate a `kustomization.yaml` (virtually not as an actual file).
The way it creates the `kustomization.yaml` is by running `kustomize create --autodetect --recursive` on the path.
Let's try to run it ourselves:

```bash
cd clusters/staging && kustomize create --autodetect --recursive
```

You will see that a `kustomization.yaml` file was created in the `clusters/staging` directory, and it contains the resources in the directory and also the subdirectories (like `flux-system` dir). It also included the `namespace.yaml` from the first lesson, this is how our namespace was created in the first lesson, by the `kustomize-controller` automatically generating a `Kustomization` resource, in the `clusters/staging` folder.

## Arranging the repository

Now that we understand the `kustomize-controller` and the `Kustomization` resource, let's arrange our repository, to be more fitting for larger projects.

Move the `clusters/staging/namespace.yaml` to the folder: `apps/base/namespace.yaml` this will represent the namespace where we will place our apps (It's important to note that I usually recommend not to throw all the apps in a single namespace if you have a large project, more logical seperation is recommended, but for the sake of simplicity we will use a single namespace for all our apps in this course).
We do need to modify the `apps/base/kustomization.yaml` file to include the `namespace.yaml` file:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - namespace.yaml
```

Delete all the `release.yaml` resources that we created, those were just for demonstration purposes, we will create them again in future lesson when we learn about the `helm-controller`.
Modify the `apps/staging/kustomization.yaml` and `apps/production/kustomization.yaml` file to include the `apps/base` directory:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - ../base
```

Also make sure you have a `clusters/staging/apps.yaml` with the following code:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: apps
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  path: ./apps/staging
  prune: true
  interval: 5m
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: flux-system
    namespace: flux-system
```

we prepared an apps overlay, and place the namespace creation in that directory. If we push our code we should see a namespace as well as an additional `Kustomization` resource created:

```bash
> kubectl get kustomization -n flux-system
```

## Summary

In this lesson we learned about:
- `kustomize` - a tool that can generate resources based on a `kustomization.yaml` file, built-in in our `kubectl` client.
- `kustomize-controller` which responds to `Kustomization` custom resource and keeps the cluster state in sync with the resources defined in a `kustomization.yaml` file.

We also learned about the `Kustomization` resource, and created a basic overlay for our `apps` as well as learned how to use `patches` which will be handy to create slight differences in our overlays.
