Do you have programming OCD like I do? Do you have nightmares if your code is not perfectly formatted and consistent between all developers? If you don't even want a single commit in the repo with not properly indent code then there are 2 options:
1. Try to cure your programming OCD.  
or more realistically
2. Create pre-commit hooks that will format your code before it is committed.

This article will not cure your OCD rather we will focus on learning about properly configuring pre-commit hooks for your project.

## pre-commit

[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks.
It allows the community to maintain a set of hooks that can be shared across multiple projects.
For example instead of recreating a hook that will run `terraform fmt` and recreate this hook in every terraform project you create, the community can share a project with pre-commit hooks that will integrate with the `pre-commit` framework.
You create a pre-commit configuration under the file `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in the root of your project, you specify in that config the repositories that are containing the hooks that you want to run before commiting your code, you run `pre-commit install` and from now on every time you commit your code the hooks will run.
Pretty simple, and luckily the community already created a Terraform/OpenTofu/Terragrunt pre-commit hooks that you can use.

## pre-commit-terraform

[pre-commit-terraform](https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform) is a collection of git hooks to be used with **pre-commit**.
We simply place the repository in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and choose the hooks that we want to run.
For now we will use a simple hook that will format our terragrunt code before committing it.

## terragrunt fmt

Reformats all Terragrunt configuration files to a canonical format, meaning the reformat is according to officially defined, standard and consistent way of organizing and formatting our configuration files according to terraform and community standards.
It is based on `terraform fmt` or `tofu fmt` commands and it will format the `.hcl` files in the project.
Among the things it will do:
- Indentation (two spaces no tabs)
- Alignment
- Spacing between blocks
- Key ordering
- Block structure
- string are quoted with double quotes
- Remove redundant spaces

The code becomes more readable and consistent between all developers.

## Install pre-commit

Let's start by installing pre-commit on our machine, we will follow the instructions from the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#installation) website.

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

If the installation was successful you should be able to run the following command to check the version of pre-commit:

```bash
pre-commit --version
```

## Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file

We can integrate the community terraform hooks by creating a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in the root of our project and including the [pre-commit-terraform](https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform) hooks that we want to use.  
For now we will only use the `terragrunt fmt` hook we is under the id `terragrunt_fmt`.

```yaml title=".pre-commit-config.yaml"
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform
    rev: v1.96.2
    hooks:
      - id: terragrunt_fmt
```

For now we only have one hook that will run `terragrunt fmt` before committing our code. But we can add more hooks from `pre-commit-terraform` or from other repositories as we move along in the project.

## Install the hooks

After our config file is ready we can install the hooks by running the following command:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

This command will install the hooks in the `.git/hooks` directory of our project.
Now every time we stage files for commit and run `git commit` the hooks will run before the commit is completed.

## Run on all the files

since we already commited a lot of files before we installed the hooks we can run the hooks on all the files in the project by running the following command:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

After that commit and push our files to the repository.

## CONTRIBUTING.md

Let's update the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to include the pre-commit hooks that we are using in the project.

## Summary

We learned how to use pre-commit hooks in our project to format our code before committing it.
We used the `pre-commit-terraform` hooks to format our terragrunt code before committing it.
We created a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in the root of our project and included the hooks that we want to use.
We installed the hooks by running `pre-commit install` and ran the hooks on all the files in the project by running `pre-commit run --all-files`.
