Unfortunately, I get to interview a lot of Node.JS developers, not a task I enjoy doing, but it's part of my job.  
One of the things that I noticed that the best developers also possess a good understanding of the underlying architecture of the technology they are using, and not just problem solving, stackoverflow copy-pasting developers.
A developers with good understanding of the theory, internals, architecture, and design of Node.JS will probably be a good Node.JS developer, and these are the developers I'm looking for.
So when I interview a lot of my questions are not coding exercise, or api, or god forbid riddles (why do interviewers ask riddles in an interview is something I will never understand), but in depth questions about the theory behind the technology they are using.

One of the questions I always ask a Node.JS developer is: **"Is Node.JS single-threaded?"**.  
TLDR; the answer is **NO**.

90% of the developers I asked this question got it wrong.
Among the popular wrong answers are:
- Yes, Node.JS is single-threaded.
- No, there are api's like: [Cluster](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/cluster.html) or [Worker Threads](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/worker_threads.html) that allow you to run multiple Node processes or multiple threads in Node.JS.  
While this answer is correct It's not exactly what I want to test here so I elaborate on the question: "In an hypothetical world where there are no api's like Cluster or Worker Threads, is Node.JS single-threaded?".  
The Cluster and worker threads api are not something a Node.JS developer uses on a daily basis, it is used for specific use cases, and not the usual everyday Node.JS development.
So when I ask if Node.JS is single-threaded, I'm asking about the everyday Node.JS development, not those special cases.
And when I explain the question again then the Developer will return to the original wrong answer: "In that case then yes, Node.JS is single-threaded if those api's are not used".

While it seems like this question is strictly theoretical, it actually touch a lot of aspects regarding the performance of our server, it's also helps us answer the important question before we start writing code: Is Node.js the right tool for the job?

## What is a Process? What is a Thread?


### Process

Before we dive into the Node.JS architecture, let's understand what is a process and what is a thread.
When we run our program with `node my-program.js` (or use other tool to run that wraps this command), we are creating a Node.JS process.
That process contains all the goodies that Node.js ships with like: V8, libuv, Event loop, etc.  
We can create multiple processes to run different programs, and each process will have its own memory space, and will run in parallel with other processes.
Processes are isolated from each other but they can communicate with each other using Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms which allows them to send messages to each other. 

### Thread

While process is more robust and isolated, threads are more lightweight. They run on the same process so unlike processes which require another Node.js instance with all it's goodies, threads are located in the same process which allows them to share memory.
Threads can communicate with each other using message passing, but they can also share memory which, we can manually create threads using the [Worker Threads](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/worker_threads.html) api.

So now that we know what is a thread and what is a process, let's return to the original question: When we are running a JavaScript program using Node.js process, is that process only using a single thread (without the use of the Cluster or Worker Threads api)?

## But look Ma, JavaScript is single-threaded

When I type in google **"JavaScript"** and navigate to the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) or [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) (or any other respectable site) they will all say JavaScript is single-threaded.
For example MDN says:

> *JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.*

So isn't it proof that Node.JS is single-threaded?

NO!

While JavaScript is a programming language, Node.JS is a runtime environment for JavaScript, although they are related, they represent different things.

## JavaScript, JavaScript Engine, and JavaScript Runtime

Let's distinguish between these 3 concepts:

### JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language defined by the [ECMAScript](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/) standard.  
It is something virtual like a blueprint or an interface of how the language should behave, and it is not something that can be executed.
It's up to the JavaScript engine to implement the language and execute the code.

### JavaScript Engine

JavaScript Engine is the implementation of the JavaScript language as defined by the ECMAScript standard.  
It will turn the JavaScript code into machine code that can be executed by the machine.
It will arrange the execution of the code in a stack (LIFO), manage a heap for the non-primitive types, clean that heap from time to time using a garbage collector.
Popular JavaScript engines are the V8 engine, SpiderMonkey, Chakra, etc.
Node.js uses the V8 engine.

### JavaScript Runtime

Let's examine the definition of the JavaScript language in the [EcmaScript standard](https://tc39.es/ecma262/).
Observing the list of features that the language should support, we will notice that a lot of the things that we use everyday are not defined there.
Things like the `console` object, the `setTimeout` function, the `fetch` function, the `require` function, etc.
These are not part of the JavaScript language, they are implemented as part of the JavaScript runtime.
While a lot of the api's we use are part of the JavaScript runtime, we will notice that a lot of them still have similar api's.
For example `console.log` is pretty similar no matter which JavaScript runtime you are using, same goes for `setTimeout`, `fetch`, etc.
There are group like the help define web standards like the [WHATWG](https://whatwg.org/) and the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) that help define the web api's that are part of the JavaScript runtime.
And the JavaScript backend runtime like Node.js strive to follow those standards.
Alot of those standarts are defined in the [WHATWG github](https://github.com/whatwg) for example you can find the standard defined for the fetch in the [fetch](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch) repository.

Among the popular JavaScript runtime are the browsers, and Node.js.
The runtimes are using the JavaScript engine to execute the JavaScript code, but they also have other parts to integrate JavaScript with the actual runtime that they represent.
For example  JavaScript do not have any api for reading files, but when you are creating a backend server then you might need to read files, so Node.js is a runtime that implemented a module for reading files, created C++ code to read files efficiently, and integrated that with the V8 engine.
JavaScript by itself will be pretty useless, it has to run somewhere, and it has to integrate with the running environment, rather it's the browsers or the OS.

## JS, JS Engine, JS Runtime which one is single-threaded?

Now let's circle back to the original question: "Is Node.JS single-threaded?".  
While everybody I asked jumped with the answer "Yes it is!" Look even wikipedia says JavaScript is single-threaded, now we are starting to understand that while JavaScript is single-threaded, Node.js is not.  
Let's go back to the concepts we just defined:

- **JavaScript** - is JavaScript single-threaded? Remeber JavaScript is a definition of a language as defined by ECMAScript, it's not the actual implementation.
What we can do is check the ECMAScript standard, and we will see that it does not define anything about threads, processes, or anything related to that.
So the answer is YES, JavaScript is defined by the ECMAScript standard as single-threaded.
- **JavaScript Engine** - Is the JavaScript engine single-threaded? The answer is an easy YES, since JavaScript is single threaded and the engine is the implementation of the language, then the engine is also single-threaded.
- **JavaScript Runtime** - I guess that depends on the runtime, but if looking at Node.js then the answer is NO, Node.js is not single-threaded.
When code reaches the C++ part of Node.js it can decide to use a thread from a thread pool or delegate the task to the kernel.

## Node.js architecture

A JavaScript runtime (like Node.JS) includes a JavaScript engine (like V8), and allows us to run JavaScript code.
Here are some of the things that are included in Node.JS architecture:
- Event queue - stores the incoming client requests
- Event loop - infinite loop that executes the requests in the event queue
- V8 engine - Executes the JavaScript code
- Thread pool - The event loop can delegate tasks to the thread pool, which is a pool of threads that can execute tasks in parallel.

The Event loop and V8 both run in the same thread (AKA the main thread), but the thread pool can run in parallel.
Node.JS is single-threaded in the sense that the Event loop and V8 run in the same thread, there is a single main thread that executes the JavaScript code.
The Event loop runs on the main thread and can handle some I/O operations in a non-blocking way, and delegate external tasks to the thread pool.

I like to look at Node.JS as automatic multi-threading, mostly I program in a single-threaded way, and Node.JS then takes care of the multi-threading for me.

## Example

Let's take a look at the following example which will help us answer the question is Node.js the right tool for the job?  
In the following example we are creating a simple express server with 2 routes:
- `/random` - will return a random number.
- `/fibonacci/:number` - will calculate the fibonacci number of the given number.

While we calculate the fibonacci number we will examine requests that try to get a random number.
We will then profile our app to understand where our main thread is stuck and then open a new thread to handle the fibonacci calculation.

Create a new folder and run npm init in that folder and install express:

```bash
mkdir nodejs-architecture
cd nodejs-architecture
npm init --yes
npm install express
```

Create the file `fibonacci.mjs` that expose a function that recursively calculate the fibonacci number:

```javascript
/**
 * recursive function to calculate the nth fibonacci number
 * @param {number} n 
 * @returns 
 */
export function fibonacci(n) {
	if (n === 0) {
		return 0;
	}
	if (n === 1) {
		return 1;
	}
	return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}
```

simple recursive function that calculates the fibonacci number.  
Now let's create the express server in the file `server.mjs`:

```javascript
import createApplication from 'express';
import { fibonacci } from './fibonacci.mjs';

const app = createApplication();

// this path will return a random number
app.get('/random', (_req, res) => {
	res.send(Math.random().toString());
});

// this path will use the fibonacci function to calculate the fibonacci number that we are getting in the path param
app.get('/fibonacci/:n(\\d+)', (req, res) => {
	const n = parseInt(req.params.n, 10);	
	const result = fibonacci(n);
	res.send(result.toString());
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
	console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

We can run our server using:

```bash
node server.mjs
```

This simple example represents the weakness of Node.js, while the fibonacci function is running the main thread is stuck and can't handle other requests.
We can activate this server and try calculating the fibonacci number of 40 for example, and then try to get a random number while the fibonacci calculation is running.
We will notice that the server is stuck, while Node.js shines in tasks like I/O operations, Database queries, etc. it is not the best tool for calculation sync tasks like the one we showed here.
In this example this is clear what is causing our main thread to get stuck, but in a real-world application it might be harder to find the bottleneck.
That is why we can profile our application to examine where the main thread is stuck.  
To run our server with the profiler we can use the following command:

```bash
node --prof server.mjs
```

after running your server with the profiler go to the routes that cause the bottleneck, in our example try to go to `/fibonacci/50` and then go to `/random` and see that the server is stuck.
After you get the server stuck time to analyze what caused the main thread to choke like it did. You will find a file that is created in the same folder with the name `isolate-0xnnnnnnnnnnnn-v8.log` we need to transfer that file to something more human readable so run the following:

```bash
node --prof-process isolate-...-v8.log > processed.txt
```

replace the `isolate-...-v8.log` with the actual file name that was created in your folder and you should see the file `processed.txt` that contains the profile of the server.
In my example it looked like the following:

```
Statistical profiling result from isolate-0x7fe6f8008000-69984-v8.log, (140861 ticks, 447 unaccounted, 0 excluded).

    447    0.3%          Unaccounted
```

our problem is in our JavaScript code, and looking at the analysis of the JavaScript code we can see that the bottleneck is in the `fibonacci` function:

```
[JavaScript]:
   ticks  total  nonlib   name
  140390   99.7%   99.7%  JS: *fibonacci file:///Users/yarivkatz/Development/academeez-node-architecture/fibonacci.mjs:8:26
	...
```

## Manually creating threads

We can manually create a thread to calculate the fibonacci number, and then delegate the task to that thread.
Change the `server.mjs` file to the following:

```javascript
import { Worker } from 'worker_threads';
// ...
function fibonacciThread(n) {
	return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
		const worker = new Worker('./fibonacci.mjs', { workerData: n });
		worker.on('message', resolve);
		worker.on('error', reject);
		worker.on('exit', (code) => {
			if (code !== 0)
				reject(new Error(`Worker stopped with exit code ${code}`));
		});
	});
}

app.get('/fibonacci/:n(\\d+)', async (req, res) => {
	// create a thread for fibonacci calculation
	const n = parseInt(req.params.n);
	const result = await fibonacciThread(n);
	res.send(result.toString());
});
// ...
```

We are creating a new thread using the `Worker` api, the thread will run the file `fibonacci.mjs` and will get the number to calculate as a parameter.
We can change the `fibonacci.mjs` file to the following:

```javascript
import { parentPort, workerData } from 'worker_threads';

export function fibonacci(n) {
	// ...
}

const result = fibonacci(workerData);

parentPort.postMessage(result);
```

If we activate our server and calculate a large fibonacci number we will see that the server is not stuck anymore, and we can still get random numbers while the fibonacci calculation is running.
If we run our server using `--prof` we will see that the main thread is not stuck anymore. We will get 2 `isolate` files one for the thread which we will notice that it spend a lot of time in the fibonacci function, and the other for the main thread which should be quite free.
What we saw is a stravation of the main thread which caused the server to be stuck, and we solved that by delegating the task to another thread and by doing so freeing the main thread to handle other requests.

Opening a new thread has a lot of overhead, so if it's something that is happening often we might consider using a thread pool.
Opening a thread is something that is not done often in Node.js, the event driven design combined with hight performance I/O operations prevents the usage of threads in most cases.
If you find out that you have to use threads often and it's the only way for you to solve your server choking problem then you might want to consider using a different technology that is more suited for that kind of tasks.
Understanding Node.js architecture if important for understanding if Node.js is the right tool for the job.

## Best Practice

In my opinion backend developers should start saying the word **NO** more often.
Let me explain what I mean by that.
Often I see backend developers are treated like Cinderella, remember the scene in Cinderella where the evil stepmother and stepsisters are throwing all the work on Cinderella while saying "Do this Cinderella, Do that Cinderella".
Often backend developers are asked from all over to do this api and that api.
The backend developer job is not to please every request the client needs, the job is to present certain logic that is oriented from the data and not from the clients.
Think of it like this, the clients wants to make "Pizze" the backend should not create and API to make "Pizze" the backend should create an API to make "Dough", "Sauce", "Cheese", etc. and then the client can use those API's to create the "Pizze".
Often with that kind of approach, calculations are done in the frontend.
So if the client asks for Pizza in one request, the backend developer should say NO.

Another example of saying no, is often the client will request an API to send him back millions of results from the database, perhaps the client is creating a Select with a lot of options.
Obviously it will be easier for the client to get all the results and place them in the Select, but this is where the backend developer should say NO, and not focus on making the client life always easier.
Instead the backend developer should say please provide me with pagination in each request, and supply the data paginated.
Often the API's that are choking the server are those that require sync computations on millions of results from the database, and since no user can actually read million records my guess is that must of the time pagination needs to play a role there.

## Summary

So to answer the question: "Is Node.JS single-threaded?".
The answer is **NO**.
Node.JS is single-threaded in the sense that the Event loop and V8 run in the same thread - which is called the main thread, but it is multi-threaded in the sense that it can delegate tasks to the thread pool, and delegate tasks to the kernel.
The event Non-Blocking nature of Node.JS allows us to utilize the main thread, thread pool, kernel, and other resources in an efficient way, and utilize the full parallel capabilities of the machine.

The way I look at it, I get automatic multi-threading without the need to manage threads most of the time (managing threads is extremely hard and error-prone), and I can focus on writing the actual application while knowing that Node.JS is taking care of the multi-threading for me.

Why am I asking this question in an interview? And why is it important to know this?  
The theory is actually connecting to the practical when it comes to main thread starvation, and how to handle it.
Knowing what the main thread is handling and what is delegated elsewhere can really help when your server is slow.
There are many times when knowing those facts helped me solve that problem, when no other developer could.
For example if your server is slow you can profile the main thread to understand what tasks are blocking the main thread, you can examine memory leaks (cause the main thread is also running the garbage collector), and in some cases, yes you will have to use the Cluster or Worker Threads api to run multiple Node processes or multiple threads in Node.JS.
