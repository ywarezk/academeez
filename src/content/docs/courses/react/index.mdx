[React](https://react.dev) is a UI library developed at Facebook to facilitate the creation of interactive, stateful & reusable UI components.  
React is the most popular UI library and is heavily used in a lot of web applications and native mobile apps.

In this free and open source React course, you will learn the fundamentals of React, including React Hooks, JSX, props, state, events, and more.  
We will use React to create a web application, we will interact with server, and learn about the popular libraries and frameworks that are used with React, such as Redux, React Router, and Next.js.

We will learn React in baby steps, taking short lessons, with plenty of online exercises in each lesson. The online exercises can be solved in the site in our online editor.
Each lesson will include a video, step by step guides, source code, and online exercises.

## Why you should learn React

There is a certain moat you will have to cross in every aspect of development you will focus on. If for example you would like to learn about web development, there are certain aspects in this field you will have to know
