import {Sandpack} from '@codesandbox/sandpack-react';

A component in React represents a logical unit in the UI.  
In most cases, that logical unit is located in the same place in the DOM as the component itself.  
There are cases where a component needs to render some ui in a different place in the DOM, and not where the component is located.  
Perhaps it's best to demonstrate with a simple example:

<div className="mt-5 not-content">
<Sandpack 
	client:load	
	template="nextjs" 
/>
</div>
