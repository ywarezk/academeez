This video tutorial explains what props are in React, how they allow you to pass data from parent to child components, and demonstrates practical examples of using props in your own React applications.
</span>

Props give us the ability to pass data from a parent component to a child component.  
Let's take a look at a few examples...

## Passing props to DOM Elements

In the following example we are creating a React component that is passing props to `<img>` which will transform to an image DOM element ([`HTMLImageElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement))

<div className="mt-5 not-content">
<Sandpack 
	client:load
	files={{
		"App.js": {
			readOnly: false,
			code: `
export default function App() {
  return (
		<img 
        height="50"
        style={{
          backgroundColor: 'red',
          opacity: 0.5,
        }}
        onClick={() => {
          console.log('hello');
        }}
        src="https://images.stockcake.com/public/1/7/e/17e62d84-37f3-42b2-af37-c08c7beba06b_large/puppy-with-toy-stockcake.jpg"
		/>
  )
}`
		}		
	}}
	template="react" 
/>
</div>

Props can give values to DOM elements properties.
In this example we are populating the `height`, `style`, `onClick`, and `src` properties of the image DOM element.

## Passing props to React components

In the following example we have 2 components `<Parent>` and `<Child>`.  
The `<Parent>` is placing the `<Child>` component and passing props to that `<Child>`.  
The `<Child>` is using those props and showing them on screen.

<div className="mt-5 not-content">
<Sandpack 
	client:load
	files={{
		"App.js": {
			readOnly: false,
			code: `
import Child from './Child';
			
export default function Parent() {
  return (
		<Child name="Academeez" age={ 5 } />
  )
}`
		},
		"Child.js": {
			readOnly: false,
			code: `
export default function Child(props) {
	return (
		<div>
			<h1>My name is {props.name}</h1>
			<p>My age is {props.age}</p>
		</div>
	)
}
			`	
		}
	}}
	template="react" 
/>
</div>

Since component are functions, those props are just the arguments passed to that function, only they are wrapped in a single object argument called `props`.  
This means that if we are passing `<Child name="Academeez" age={ 5 } />` than the `<Child>` function:

```js
export default function Child(props) {
	...
}
```

will get a single argument (usually we name that `props` but it can be named differently) which looks like the following `Object`: `{name: 'Academeez', age: 5}`.

We can also use [`destructuring`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring) to grab those props like so:

```js
export default function Child({name, age}) {
	return (
		<div>
			<h1>My name is {name}</h1>
			<p>My age is {age}</p>
		</div>
	)
}
```

## Summary

In this introduction to `Props` we learned that `Props` is a mechanism for passing data from parent to child components in React.  
We can either use it to set properties on Dom Elements or to pass data to React components.  
In the following chapter about `Props` we will have a dedicated lessons about:
- Passing props to Dom Elements
- Passing props to React components
- Props and TypeScript
- Best practices and common patterns with props
