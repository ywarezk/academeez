import {Sandpack} from '@codesandbox/sandpack-react';

When we are thinking about creating a React Component, ideally we want that component to be written in a way so it can be reused throughout our application.
To achieve that we often need to pass data from parent component to the child component.
In this lesson we will discuss about passing props to child components.

## Simple example - Avatar

In the following example we are creating an **Avatar** component that will get from the parent data about a user and will display an avatar of that user.

<div className="mt-5 not-content">
<Sandpack 
	client:load
	files={{
    "Avatar.js": {
      code: `
export default function Avatar(props) {
    return (
      <div style={{
          display: 'flex',
          flexDirection: 'column',
          justifyContent: 'center',
          alignItems: 'center',
          gap: '10px'
        }}
      >
        <img src={props.img} height="48" width="48" />
        <span>
          {props.name}
        </span>
      </div>
  )
}      
      `
    },
		"App.js": {			
			code: `
import Avatar from './Avatar';
      
export default function App() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>The parent is placing the Avatar component</p>      
        <Avatar name="Yariv Katz" img="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2714362?v=4" />
        <p>passing props: name and img to the Avatar Component</p>
      </div>
    )
}`
		}
	}}
	template="react" 
/>
</div>

We are creating a child component `<Avatar />` which is getting a name and the image of the user from the parent.
Passing props which are of type `string` do not require us to place the value inside `{}` curly braces

## Avatar - User object

it's best to keep API of a component simple and consistent.
Simple for example can be, if we have some sort of function (or hook - hooks will be learned later on) that returns a user, might be simpler to allow our component to receive an object that represents our user.
instead of forcing developers to extract information from the user.
Consistent means that if other comoponents are getting a prop called `user` with the user object and we are suddenly forcing in this specific component to extract the name and the image, the inconsistency is not only a hassle for developers
but in general keeping things consistent in programming allow us to view repeating patterns more easily and easily plan for a generic solution that will fit many cases.
In the following example our `<Avatar />` component will get a user object.

<div className="mt-5 not-content">
<Sandpack 
	client:load
	files={{
    "Avatar.js": {
      code: `
export default function Avatar(props) {
    return (
      <div style={{
          display: 'flex',
          flexDirection: 'column',
          justifyContent: 'center',
          alignItems: 'center',
          gap: '10px'
        }}
      >
        <img src={props.user.img} height="48" width="48" />
        <span>
          {props.user.name}
        </span>
      </div>
    )
}      
      `
    },
		"App.js": {			
			code: `
import Avatar from './Avatar';
      
export default function App() {
    const user = { name: 'Yariv Katz', img: 'https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2714362?v=4' }
    return (
        <div>
          <p>The parent is placing the Avatar component</p>      
          <Avatar user={user} />
          <p>passing props: name and img to the Avatar Component</p>
        </div>
    )
}`
		}
	}}
	template="react" 
/>
</div>

Notice how a type that is different than a string has to be wrapped in `{}` curly braces.

```jsx
<Avatar user={user} />
```

## Destructuring props

In the previous example we passed prop called `user` which is an object that has `name` and `img` properties.
So to access the `name` and `img` properties we had to do `props.user.name` and `props.user.img`.
This is not very convenient, so we can destructure the props object and get the `user` directly to a variable called `user`.

```js
export default function Avatar({user}) {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src={user.img} height="48" width="48" />
      <span>{user.name}</span>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Destructuring is a powerful feature that allows us to extract properties from an object (or an array) and assign them to variables.
More on destructuring can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment).

## optional prop and default value

We can also decide that a certain prop is optional, for example in our `<Avatar />` component we can make the `user` prop optional and decide that if no user is passed, we will type anonymous user.

```js
export default function Avatar({user}) {  
  if (!user) {
    return <div>Anonymous user</div>
  }
  
  return (
    <div>
      <img src={user.img} height="48" width="48" />
      <span>{user.name}</span>
    </div>
  )
}
```

We can also set a default value for the `user` prop.

```js
export default function Avatar({user = {name: 'Anonymous', img: 'https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2714362?v=4'}}) {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src={user.img} height="48" width="48" />
      <span>{user.name}</span>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## spread operator

[spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) is a powerful feature that allows us to spread the properties of an object (or an array) into another object (or an array).
The same syntax can also be used to pass props to a component.
In the following example our component is getting `age`, `name`, and `city` properties.

```js
export default function Avatar({age, name, city}) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My name is {name}</h1>
      <p>My age is {age}</p>
      <p>My city is {city}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

In the following example we are passing the `age`, `name`, and `city` properties to the `<Avatar />` component.

```js
export default function App() {
  return (
    <Avatar age={30} name="Yariv" city="Tel Aviv" />
  )
}
```

Notice how we are spreading the `age`, `name`, and `city` properties into the `<Avatar />` component.

another way we can pass props to a component is to use the spread operator.

```js
export default function App() {
  const data = {age: 30, name: 'Yariv', city: 'Tel Aviv'}
  return (
    <Avatar {...data} />
  )
}
```

Notice how we are spreading the `age`, `name`, and `city` properties into the `<Avatar />` component.

This is also useful if a component is getting a lot of props and we want to pass them all to the component.
so in the following example our parent component is getting that information from it's own props and we want to pass them all to the `<Avatar />` component.

```js
export default function App(props) {
  return (
    <Avatar {...props} />
  )
}
```

## Events

A component can define events, for example in our `<Avatar />` component we can define the event `onClick` when the avatar is clicked.
We can accept a prop called `onClick` and a function that will be called when the avatar is clicked.

```js
export default function Avatar({onClick, img}) {
  return (
    <div onClick={onClick}>
      <img src={img} height="48" width="48" />
    </div>
  )
}
```

this will allow the parent to subscribe to the `onClick` event and call the function when the avatar is clicked.

```js
export default function App() {
  const handleAvatarClick = () => {
    console.log('Avatar clicked!')
  }
  return (
    <Avatar onClick={handleAvatarClick} img="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2714362?v=4" />
  )
}
```

## Summary

In this lesson we learned about passing props to React components.
Passing props gives us more reusability and flexibility in our components. It allows a component to fit better in other places thus open the possibility for reusability.
There are certain patterns in the props aspect that you need to familiarize yourself since they are commonly used in React.
Deciding on an API of a component meaning what props it will get is crucial, think about the props, are they required or optional, if they are optional should they have a default value?
Try to aim for repeating API's so if one component is getting a prop called `user` and another is getting `name` and `img` then it's better to keep API's consistent and use the same prop name for the same type of data.
You can also use the spread operator to pass all the props to a component, this is useful if a component is getting a lot of props and we want to pass them all to the component.
You can also define events on a component, this is useful if you want to allow the parent to subscribe to an event and call a function when the event is triggered.

In the next lesson we will talk about props in the realm of TypeScript and we will learn about some types that are commonly used in React.
