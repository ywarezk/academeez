In the following course we will learn how to manage our cloud resources using [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform) or [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/).
It is highly recommended to not use the cloud provider's web console to create or manage your cloud resources, but rather use IaC (Infrastructure as Code) tools like Terraform/OpenTofu/Terragrunt.
We will explain how to work properly with the cloud and focus on best practice, while supplying a repository starter kit that will help you to get started with your own cloud resources management.

## GCP

The cloud provider we will work with is [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/), you can use different cloud provider and the concepts are very similar, but there are some differences in the way you create and manage your cloud resources
so it is recommended to use GCP for this course.

## What you need to prepare for this course

Before you can start following on these lessons you will need an account in GCP, that account will be used to create and manage your cloud resources.
You will also need to install [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) command line tool, which will be used to manage your cloud resources from the command line.

## Repository

The course repository is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ywarezk/academeez-k8s-flux)

The repository does not only contain IAC course but also contains the FluxCD course, since we will use FluxCD to manage our kubernetes cluster and we will use Terraform/OpenTofu to manage our cloud resources.

The repository is arranged as a starter kit, so even if you don't have time to follow the course, you can clone the repository and use it as a starter kit for your own k8s cluster management on GCP with FluxCD

If you like the work on the repository please make sure to give it a star on GitHub, and if you have any questions or suggestions please open an issue on the repository.
