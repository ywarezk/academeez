    title: "change root terragrunt.hcl to root.hcl"
---

We will dedicate a few lessons in our course to talk about [Terragrunt Terminology](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/terminology/).
Specifically we will focus on [Units](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/units/) and [Stacks](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/stacks/).
We will understand those concepts as well as learn to apply them in our codebase.

In this lesson we will focus on **Units**

## What is a Unit

A Unit represents a single instance of infrastructure managed by Terragrunt. Here are a few characteristics:
- It has its own state
- It is in a folder which has a `terragrunt.hcl` file
- It is often minimalistic and represents a small piece of infrastructure.
- A unit can interact with another unit using [dependency blocks](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/hcl/blocks#dependency).

An example of a unit in our repository: [root folder](https://github.com/ywarezk/academeez-k8s-flux/tree/main/iac/gcp/tofu/common/folders/root).
We have a unit which creates our course root folder, this is a very minimal piece of infrastructure which other units use with dependency blocks.

## Bad Practice - root terragrunt.hcl

In the past it was common to have a `terragrunt.hcl` file in the root of the repository.
Just like in our repository: [root terragrunt.hcl](https://github.com/ywarezk/academeez-k8s-flux/tree/main/iac/gcp/tofu).
That root `terragrunt.hcl` did not really represent a unit, it was more of a shared configuration for all the units in the repository.

Other units would include the root `terragrunt.hcl` using:

```hcl
include "root" {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
```

And in this file we defined providers configuration, remote state configuration and impersonation logic.

The [find_in_parent_folders](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/hcl/functions/#find_in_parent_folders) function would search up the directory tree from the current `terragrunt.hcl` file and return the absolute path to the first file it finds named `terragrunt.hcl` if nothing supplied to the function, or the name of the file supplied.
It allowed us to easily find the parent `terragrunt.hcl` file without hardcoding the path and including that shared configuration.
There are a few problems with this approach:
- The root `terragrunt.hcl` is not really a unit, it does not represent a single piece of infrastructure, and it is not runnable by itself.
- That fact will often break running `terragrunt run-all` commands from the root of the repository, as it will try to run the root `terragrunt.hcl` which is not a unit.
- The pattern might break if we have parent folders that are units and have `terragrunt.hcl` files in them.

This is why it is no longer recommended to name root file that represents shared logic as `terragrunt.hcl` - which usually represent a unit - but rather give it a different name like `root.hcl` or `common.hcl`.
A name that will mark that file as shared logic and not runnable unit which defines an infrastructure piece.

## Migrate to root.hcl

We will follow this [migration guide](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/migrate/migrating-from-root-terragrunt-hcl/) and change the name of our root `terragrunt.hcl` to `root.hcl`.
After we rename the file we will need to update the `find_in_parent_folders` function to look for `root.hcl` instead of `terragrunt.hcl`.
So from:

```hcl
include "root" {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
```

To:

```hcl
include "root" {
  path = find_in_parent_folders("root.hcl")
}
```

You can examine the migration in the following [PR](https://github.com/ywarezk/academeez-k8s-flux/pull/11)

## Summary

A unit represents a single piece of infrastructure with its own state.
A unit is in a folder with a `terragrunt.hcl` file.
Since our root `terragrunt.hcl` file did not represent a unit, we renamed it to `root.hcl` and updated all the `find_in_parent_folders` functions to look for `root.hcl` instead of `terragrunt.hcl`.
